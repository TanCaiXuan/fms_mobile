  // Basic Flood Information
  "Flood is an overflow of water onto normally dry land.",
  "Flood warnings are issued when rivers or streams are expected to exceed flood stage.",
  "Floods are the most common and dangerous natural disasters.",
  "Floods cause serious devastation and disrupt the daily operations of impacted areas.",
  "Floods occur when low-lying areas accumulate water from heavy rain or nearby rivers.",
  "During heavy rains, elevated areas may appear like islands while low-lying areas become submerged.",

  // Flood Severity
  "Flood situations can range from mild to severe.",
  "A mild flood situation may involve a road being flooded due to a blocked drain.",
  "A severe flood situation may involve entire households being submerged.",
  "In severe flood situations, people may need to find temporary shelter until the water recedes or evaporates.",

  // Flood Response and Immediate Actions
  "In case of a flood, move to higher ground and avoid walking or driving through floodwaters.",
  "Prepare a Go Bag with essential items like food, water, and first aid supplies.",
  "If you're trapped in floodwaters, stay on the highest point available and wait for rescue.",
  "During severe flooding, make sure to stay in communication with local authorities for evacuation updates.",

  // Regional Flood Information (Malaysia)
  "Johor, located in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia, is affected by flooding during the Northeast Monsoon season from December to January.",
  "Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, faces periodic flooding during heavy monsoon rains, especially in low-lying areas.",
  "Pahang and Terengganu are prone to seasonal flooding due to heavy rainfall during the monsoon period.",
  "Flooding in Sarawak and Sabah, located on Borneo Island, is caused by heavy rainfall and rising river levels.",

  // Flood Management System in Malaysia
  "The Flood Management System in Malaysia is primarily a top-down government responsibility.",
  "Malaysians heavily rely on a top-down government-controlled techno-centric approach to flood management.",
  "When a disaster occurs, the Malaysian government announces a state of emergency in affected states and deploys teams of rescuers and aid workers for relief efforts.",
  "The flood management system can serve as an integrated approach to reduce the impact of floods, minimize property and life losses, and ensure accurate tracking of people involved through real-name registration.",
  "Evacuation centers are set up by local authorities, and they provide temporary shelter, food, and essential supplies to flood victims.",

  // Early Warning and Monitoring
  "There is a current lack of effective early warning systems, which can result in delayed responses and increased vulnerability to flood hazards.",
  "Traditional methods of flood prediction and monitoring often fail to provide timely alerts to at-risk communities.",
  "Real-time monitoring and early warning systems can address this issue by detecting users in flood-prone areas and notifying them to evacuate or alerting them to the high probability of a flood.",
  "The Malaysian government has implemented the National Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (NAFFWC), which provides early warnings and advisories on flood risks.",
  "Flood warning systems use data from weather stations, rainfall predictions, and river monitoring to provide flood alerts to affected regions.",

  // Preparedness and Resilience
  "People in flood-prone areas often lack adequate preparedness and resilience strategies to withstand and recover from floods.",
  "Insufficient infrastructure, inadequate emergency response plans, and limited public awareness contribute to heightened vulnerabilities and exacerbate the impacts of floods.",
  "Flood-prone areas should have resilient infrastructure, including elevated buildings and flood-resistant construction materials.",
  "Residents in flood-prone areas are encouraged to sign up for flood alerts and stay informed about flood risks in their region.",
  "Adequate flood response plans, such as community evacuation routes and shelter locations, should be in place before floods occur.",
  "Public awareness campaigns can help teach communities about flood risks, emergency procedures, and evacuation plans.",

  // Community Preparedness
  "Communities should maintain and regularly update evacuation plans, including clear routes to evacuation centers.",
  "Important documents, medicines, and essential items should be packed in a Go Bag for easy access during an emergency.",
  "In the event of a flood, households should have an emergency contact plan to stay in touch with family members and neighbors.",

  // Flood Recovery
  "After a flood, residents must ensure their homes are safe before returning, checking for structural damage and avoiding contact with floodwaters.",
  "Disaster recovery teams work with local governments to provide assistance in rebuilding efforts and offer psychological support to victims.",
  "Flood-affected areas require prompt cleanup efforts to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases and ensure the safety of residents.",

  // Government and NGO Support
  "The Malaysian government collaborates with NGOs and local organizations to provide aid and assistance during flood disasters.",
  "NGOs, such as the Malaysian Red Crescent Society and local humanitarian organizations, play a crucial role in providing relief, food, and medical supplies to flood victims.",
  "Disaster relief efforts focus on supplying essential resources like food, clean water, medical care, and temporary shelter to affected communities.",

  // Long-term Mitigation Strategies
  "Investing in flood prevention infrastructure, such as better drainage systems and flood barriers, is essential for reducing flood risks.",
  "The government has begun implementing river diversion projects and dam constructions to better manage floodwaters during heavy rains.",
  "Reforestation programs and soil erosion control measures can help reduce the frequency and severity of flooding in certain areas.",
  "Encouraging flood-resilient urban planning and sustainable land management practices can help mitigate flood risks in the long term."

  // Checklist
  "The checkilst function of the flood management system is used to provides a comprehensive guide for emergency preparedness, divided by time availability. Immediately, one should remain calm and gather essential items like important documents, medicine, phone, wallet, and pet supplies, while also completing necessary reports. A Go Bag should be packed with supplies such as water, food, medical items, warmth, shelter, lighting, and a radio. If there is an hour, essential toiletries should be packed, windows and doors secured, and irreplaceable items like toys and photos gathered. With more than an hour, further preparations include securing the structure, removing outdoor hazards, reinforcing the building, and locating an evacuation center. Finally, always ensure a Go Bag is available in key locations, the vehicle has sufficient fuel, and the garage door can be manually opened."
